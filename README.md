 Demo rendering a triangular bezier patch using mesh shaders. 
 Building it requires C++17 features, Windows SDK 2004 and hardware with mesh shader support
 
 This demo builds on top of Microsoft's DirectX samples for mesh shaders
 The demo is meant to be a learning exercise, so it may contain overlooked inefficiencies
